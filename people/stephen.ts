    bio: "Stephen P. Kaputsos is a perceptual AI/ML engineer & neuroroboticist  who leverages his interdisciplinary background in perceptual AI, robotics, AR/VR (XR), and sensory neuroscience to engineer technologies that enhance both human and machine perception. Current works involve AI & robotic simulation design and modeling of perceptual processing architectures. Other endeavors employ extended reality (XR) technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), to enhance human-robot task performance. Well-developed abilities in applying perceptual & cognitive principles to optimize the engineering of XR and human-machine systems. Skilled in integration of neuroimaging technologies with virtual simulations.",
