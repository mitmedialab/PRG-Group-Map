      "description": "We take as a starting point for our work the recent scholarship by Sasha Costanza-Chock, Design Justice, in which she described design justice as a framework for analysis of how design distributes benefits and burdens between various groups of people. \nIn addition, design justice calls for attention to how “design reproduces and/or challenges the matrix of domination.” \nThe project aims to develop methods for design justice audits in classrooms, in academia broadly, and in the design process in educational institutions and corporations. \nOur work also extends to creating guidelines to inform how design justice can be leveraged in technology design processes and policy development. \nOverall, this project audits institutions to understand how they engage in design justice (critique) and suggests ways to achieve design justice in a variety of spaces (solutions). \nThis combines for a focus on both critique and design solutions.\n\nOur overarching theme is to understand how design and justice are taught, intertwined, and embodied and what techniques are successful and what aren’t for engaging with design justice in varying settings. \nWe use MIT as an exemplar for extracting design pedagogy and justice best practices. We are specifically mindful of and intrigued by design pedagogy paradigms, encoded values, and student, instructor, and community partner experiences. \nThis often includes identifying exemplars of how MIT currently incorporates design justice into design pedagogy, suggesting future techniques to increase design justice’s presence in the classroom, and designing new methods to support design justice in design pedagogy. \nOur approach can be expanded to other educational institutions and corporate settings.",

Over a year-long co-design project, we partnered with 28 older adults to understand how social robots should be designed, specifically exploring the areas of medical adherence, emotional wellness, social connection, financial management, memory, body signal monitoring, and exercise.\n\nThe study was divided in 7 parts: initial interviews, art-based design sessions, robot hosting, debrief of robot hosting experience, rapid robot prototyping, design guideline sessions, & reflection interview with card-sorting.\n\nInitial results reveal how older adults want social robots to be design and illuminate older adults' concerns for having AI systems in their homes. This methodology applied to social robot design demonstrates how users can and should be involved in designing AI that will socially impact the world. The methodology can be expanded and applied to other demographics affected by AI and focus areas of AI, such as public health and education.",

      "description": "Increasingly, devices designed with artificial intelligence (AI), such as robots or smart speakers, are entering people's homes, workspaces, and environments. \nMany home robots are made to interact with users in an interpersonal way and can be designed to be socially persuasive. \nThis translates to an increased need for policy around these devices surrounding dimensions including autonomy, bias, social persuasion, privacy, emotional deception, and transparency. \nPrevious works have revealed, when people explore designing these devices, they express concerns around privacy, autonomy and transparency and design to adjust for these concerns. \nOther work has shown that with the proper scaffolding, students are able to identify the socio-political aspects of technology. \nOur project builds upon these works to extend beyond participatory design of these devices and learn more about how people would design policy around these technology dimensions. \nUltimately, through expanding the research to policy design, we can engage in participatory democracy in policy around these devices.\n\nThe Robot Policy Design Toolkit is designed to allow any generation to design and consider how we can develop policy for social robot technologies around nine ethic topics. \nThe toolkit is situated around the context of you in your home considering how policy around robots may affect your environment and interactions with technology and other people. \nIn the toolkit, people select and \"pass\" laws for social robots and structure various policies with these laws around topics such as autonomy, data bias, data privacy, and social persuasion.\n\nAs agents are beginning to enter people's homes, smart speakers and robots are generating legal and policy issues that require developers to reconsider the design of these technologies and how we should design future policies around these devices. \nSocial robots are a much more powerful piece of technology than we've seen before because of their ability to engage people in a natural way of interaction. \nWe need to investigate what this means and need to be proactive when we design policies around these technologies. \nIt is important to incorporate the voices of those who will be impacted. The investigations surrounding these topics and design of these devices must include people of all ages, allowing researchers to compare between generations. \nAn intergenerational approach also includes children and older adults who are typically left out of the design conversation of these devices.",

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's degree in computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence and networking. I enjoy playing with data and developing technologies that leverage data. My current research at MIT focuses on building a cognitive architecture for tobots like Tega, incorporating inputs from speech and vision. Prior to this, I worked on wearable computing and algorithms to help artificially intelligent agents learn from human feedback. Last summer, I interned on the philanthropy team at Palantir, developing technologies to help farmers in the Philippines and Colombia. Before that, I interned at Microsoft on the Identity Driven Machine Learning team, building models to detect suspicious login activities.\n\nOutside of research, I like to explore new places, food, and adventure sports.",
