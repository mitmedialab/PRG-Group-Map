The toolkit is situated around the context of you in your home considering how policy around robots may affect your environment and interactions with technology and other people. In the toolkit, people select and "pass" laws for social robots and structure various policies with these laws around topics such as autonomy, data bias, data privacy, and social persuasion.",

            summary: "The project aims to develop methods for design justice audits in classrooms, in academia broadly, and in the design process in educational institutions and corporations. Our work also extends to creating guidelines to inform how design justice can be leveraged in technology design processes and policy development. Overall, this project audits institutions to understand how they engage in design justice (critique) and suggests ways to achieve design justice in a variety of spaces (solutions). This combines for a focus on both critique and design solutions.",
