The Knowledge and Societal Impact curriculum teaches students about the technical and ethical topics surrounding social robots. The Programming curriculum allows students to program their own conversational skills on Jibo. These curricula represent two pedagogical approaches in the field of AI education, one focused on embedding ethics, and the other focused on students as self-driven makers.",
