Prior to this, I worked on wearable computing and algorithms to help artificially intelligent agents learn from human feedback. Last summer, I interned on the philanthropy team at Palantir, developing technologies to help farmers in the Philippines and Colombia. Before that, I interned at Microsoft on the Identity Driven Machine Learning team, building models to detect suspicious login activities.\n\nOutside of research, I like to explore new places, food, and adventure sports.",
