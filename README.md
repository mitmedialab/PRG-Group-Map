Organizing the (wonderful) people and (exciting) projects of the Personal Robotics Group

# How to:

## Add yourself

1. Create a new typescription file (`.ts` extension) inside of the `people/` directory. For example, `cynthia.ts`.

2. This code file will be responsible for doing one thing, which is calling the `describeYourself` function. This function takes a single paramter, which is an object that, well, describes yourslef. Check out the below example:

```ts
// Inside of cynthia.ts


```

3. Use type hints, typescript errors, and code documentation (visible when you hover over a field/') to fill out the function's argument properly.
